            <p class="Main-description">This charity is for the hungry stray dogs in the town of Doeist. We will raise money to feed them high quality steaks, and the amount of money needed to sufficiently feed the stray dogs would be around $5000 - $6000.</p>
            <p class="popout-text">We would appreciate any amount of money your willing to donate.</p>
